# kibrom-generative-lab

A personal playground for building and understanding generative models — from VAEs to Diffusion, Transformers, and beyond.  
Curious, simple, and open to everyone.

## 🚀 What's Inside

| Model Type          | Project                                        | Status      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Variational Autoencoders (VAE) | `notebooks/vae_basics.ipynb`                 | ✅ Complete |
| GANs                | `notebooks/gan_mnist.ipynb`                     | 🔧 In Progress |
| Transformer         | `notebooks/char_transformer.ipynb`             | 🔧 In Progress |
| Diffusion Models    | `notebooks/ddpm_intro.ipynb`                    | 🔜 Planned |
| Experiments         | `experiments/vae_gan_fusion/`                  | 🔜 Planned |

## 🛠 Goals

- 🔍 Deepen my understanding of core generative models  
- ✍️ Turn journal notes into runnable, reproducible code  
- 🌍 Make learning approachable for others exploring the same path

## 📚 Requirements

Set up with:

```bash
conda create -n genlab python=3.10
conda activate genlab
pip install -r requirements.txt
